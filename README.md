### Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the following projects and their contributors for their inspiration and valuable resources:

- [**LangChain**](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain): LangChain is an AI-driven natural language to programming language translation platform. It significantly contributed to the development of this project by providing essential tools and resources for translating human-readable instructions into executable code. We highly appreciate their work and encourage you to check out their project.

- [**Agent-Actors**](https://github.com/shaman-ai/agent-actors): Agent-Actors is a proof-of-concept project inspired by BabyAGI, the Plan-Do-Check-Adjust (PDCA) cycle, and the actor model of concurrency. This project was a stepping stone in the development of our current repository, and we want to acknowledge the ideas and implementation details that have helped shape our work.

Thank you for your contributions and for helping to make this project a reality.
